## How does React Context work? Pros and cons?

Answer:
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without props drilling.

`const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");

<ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
  <App />
</ThemeContext.Provider>

const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);`


Pros:

No prop drilling

Good for theme, auth, locale

Cons:

Re-renders all consumers when value changes

Not suitable for high-frequency updates (like mouse move)

## How would you optimize performance in large React apps?
Answer:

Code splitting using React.lazy + Suspense

Virtualize long lists (e.g., react-window, react-virtual)

Avoid unnecessary re-renders with:

React.memo

useMemo, useCallback

shouldComponentUpdate / PureComponent

Use key correctly in lists

Avoid anonymous functions in JSX

Debounce user input, network requests


## What is React Fiber?

Answer:
React Fiber is the new reconciliation algorithm in React (since v16) that enables:

Incremental rendering

Time slicing

Suspense and concurrent features

It breaks work into units and can pause, abort, or resume rendering work.
